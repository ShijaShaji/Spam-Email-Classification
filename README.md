# Spam-Email-Classification
Classification of emails to spam and non-spam emails using Logistic Regression
The Spam Email dataset from Kaggle is used in this project . (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/somesh24/spambase?resource=download) 
The dataset contains more than 5000 rows and 58 columns out of which the last column is the class label.
A spam email has a class label of +1 and a non-spam email has a class label of 0. (This has been scaled as +1 and -1 in the code for ease of understanding)
Most of the attributes indicate whether a particular word or character was frequently occurring in the e-mail. The run-length attributes (55-57) measure the length of sequences of consecutive capital letters.
More information on all attributes can be found on the mentioned kaggle link.
